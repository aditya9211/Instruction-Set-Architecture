# Instruction-Set-Architecture


Instructions:

	• Run "part1.c" using gcc compiler by giving Assembly Language Instructions From Console
	
	• then Run "part2.c" , and get the desired results.
	
	
	
Info:

• 	Developed an I.S.A using two pass assembler which performs 
	Basic Arithmetic and Logical Operations
	
• 	I.S.A which understand user inputs(assembly language codes (32 bits) and gives desired outputs



Two pass assembler Implementation with hypothetical Instruction Set Architecture using C .

Pass 1 : 	Read Assembly Language Instructions From Console and create the Symbol Table , mnemonic op-code table and operand fields
			and convert the whole Instructions into Machine Level Code .
			Determine the storage required for each Assembly Language statement and Updation of location counter.
			
Pass 2 :	Extract the Instructions from Machine Code File , using translation of op-code and symbolic operands specified by I.S.A
			and generate value defined by different Instructions.
